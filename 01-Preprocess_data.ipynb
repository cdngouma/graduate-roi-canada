    "The preprocessing steps were implemented in a modular Jupyter Notebook and follow a structured ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extract\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data is sourced from CSV files downloaded from Statistics Canada and other official open data sources.\n",
    "- The datasets include:\n",
    "  - Tuition costs (2006–2025)\n",
    "  - Graduation counts by field and education level\n",
    "  - Median income five years post-graduation\n",
    "  - Labour market outcomes from the census (2011, 2016, 2021)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tuition Data**: Renamed columns, extracted the starting year from academic ranges (e.g., \"2010/2011\" becomes 2010), and filtered out aggregate categories. Education level was added to each row.\n",
    "- **Graduation Data**: Cleaned field names, unified education levels (Bachelor's, Master's, Doctoral → Undergraduate, Graduate), and filtered for Canadian-wide data.\n",
    "- **Income Data**: Removed summary categories (e.g., STEM, BHASE), standardized field names, and derived `Graduation Year` from `Survey Year - 5`.\n",
    "- **Labour Data**: Parsed raw files for census years, removed metadata rows, standardized columns, and cleaned up annotations from field names.\n",
    "- **Field of Study Normalization**: Applied a universal mapping across datasets to ensure consistent field names.\n",
    "- **Education Level Unification**: For field-level analysis, education types were merged under a single \"Postsecondary\" category.\n",
    "- **Aggregation**:\n",
    "  - Graduates were summed per year and field.\n",
    "  - Tuition was computed as a weighted average based on graduate counts.\n",
    "  - Median income values were retained at the field-year level (not education-specific).\n",
    "- **Census Alignment**: Each observation year was mapped to its nearest census year (2001, 2006, 2011, 2016, 2021, or 2026) to match labour force data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Load\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cleaned and aggregated datasets were exported as CSV files for downstream analysis:\n",
    "  - `postsecondary_field_outcomes.csv`: Combined tuition, graduates, and income data by field and year.\n",
    "  - `postsecondary_labour_outcomes.csv`: Census-based labour indicators by field of study."

The data is sourced from the Tuition and Living Accommodation Costs survey. Notably, a correction was made on October 21, 2020, to address an error affecting the 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 data for one Alberta college, impacting average tuition fees for Alberta and Canada in certain fields.

    "This combined dataset draws from Canadian census and National Household Survey data (2011, 2016, and 2021) to provide a cross-sectional view of the labour force status by major field of study, highest certificate, diploma or degree, and demographic characteristics such as age and gender. Each dataset reflects the population aged 15 years and over in private households at the national level. The data are sourced from the 25% sample of the census and NHS populations. By aligning these datasets, we analyze trends in educational attainment and employment outcomes across time. Our focus remains on national-level comparisons across years and fields of study."

    "To ensure consistency across all datasets, we select the Graduation data's Field of study categories as our standard reference. This dataset offers a concise and balanced list of academic fields that are broad enough to encompass the terminology used in the other datasets. We may then use a dictionary-based mapping approach to align the field names from Tuition, Income, and Labour data to this standardized list. This method would be more appropriate than NLP techniques due to the small number of distinct categories and the categorical nature of the data, making direct mapping more reliable and transparent."

    "### Creating Final Datasets\n",
    "To effectively evaluate the return on investment and real-world value of higher education by field of study, we constructed two aligned datasets. The first dataset combines tuition costs, graduation counts, and median income (five years post-graduation) across all postsecondary education levels, aggregated by Year and Field of study. This enables us to analyze the economic outcomes of different disciplines based on what graduates typically pay, how many enter the workforce, and what they earn after gaining moderate experience. We also include a Census Year column, which links each observation year to the closest available labour market snapshot from the Canadian census (2011, 2016, 2021). The second dataset contains these census-based labour outcomes, including participation, employment, and unemployment rates by Field of study. By aligning both datasets on Census Year and Field of study, we enable cross-sectional analysis of how education supply, cost, and income align with real-world employment conditions over time."
